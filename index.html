    <h2>Tom and Jerry</h2>
    <p>Tom and Jerry are the funniest of cartoon characters. The animation series shows the story of a pet cat Tom who has to chase out the naughty mouse Jerry. Jerry is always troubling Tom and stealing things from the house. Poor Tom is always trying to catch Jerry but always fails. Jerry, though naughty, is an intelligent mouse who at times, also helps Tom. And sometimes, even Tom helps Jerry when someone else troubles him. But soon, they are back to being enemies. The funny chase and run of these two characters is what makes this cartoon series stand out. Though Tom and Jerry are always fighting, their friendship is still evident. They teach me that we may fight with our friends, but when our friends need us, we should always be there for them.</p>
